## World Wide Web(Web)

<br>

### The Web is a massive network of webpages, programs, and files that are accessible via URLs.

<br>

### It uses the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol to convert a domain name into an IP address.

<br>

### It uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to request the webpage contents from that IP address.

<br>

### It may also use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to serve the website over a secure, encrypted connection.

<br>

### The web browser uses these protocols on top of the Internet protocols, so every HTTP request also uses TCP and IP.
