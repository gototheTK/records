## Code Structure

### Statements

### Semicolons

<p>
semicolon means the end of a line in statements. Because Javascript interprets a line break as an "implicit" semicolon, it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it's recommended putting semicolons between statements evn if they are separated by new lines. Or it is possible to occur error.

### hoisting

In Javascript, declaration of var or function is processed at function start(or script start for globes).
