## The Internet

<br>

### The Internet is an open network of WAN(Wide Area Network) Types.

<br/>

### The Internet needs physical connections(Wire or Wireless) and protocols like rules to interchange data.

<br/>

### The Protocols the Internet needs are Wires & wireless(for converting electromagnetic signals into binary data), IP((for uniquely identifying and a routing strategy), TCP/UDP(for transporting packets and checking errors), and TLS(for encrypting data), HTTP & DNS(For World Wide Web browsers use).

## Computer Network

<br/>

### Network is a group of more than 2 computing devices.

<br/>

### The ways of building a network are ring, mesh, star, bus, and tree topologies

<br/>

### Types of networks are LAN(Local Area Network), WAN(Wide Area Network), and DCN(Data Center Network).

<br/>

### Whenever computing devices are connected in a network, they need protocols to communicate with each other. The Internet needs Internet networking protocols.

## Physical network connections

<br>

### There are typically 3 ways for a network connection. These are Twisted pair copper cables, Fiber-optic cables, and Wireless. They are commonly used together.

<br>

### Twisted pair copper cables are a wire technology using electricity. It follows the Ethernet standards and is used in both LAN and WAN. In issues, It has susceptible to interference problems.

<br>

### Fiber-optic cables are a technology carrying light pulses. It also typically follows Ethernet standards and is fast than copper cables. It is used in both oceans and cities. But it is still expensive as it becomes less.

<br>

### Wireless is a technology using radio pulses. A wireless card inside the computer turns binary data into radio waves and transmits them through the air. Those radio waves can’t travel very far and are affected by obstacles. Thus, the communication way is slow.

## TCP(Transport Control Protocol)

<br>

### Built on top of IP

<br>

### Assumes IP might lose some data - stores and retransmits data if it seems to be lost.

<br>

### Handles “flow control” using a transmit window

### Provides a nice reliable pipe

## Socket

<br>

### A socket is an endpoint of bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-based computer network. And an identifier to identify a process on the specific computer in specific computer networking based on TCP. For example, 123.123.123:80 and so on.

## TCP Port Numbers

<br>

### A port is an application-specific or process-specific software communications endpoint.

<br>

### It allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server.

<br>

### There is a list of well-known TCP port numbers.

<br>

    - Telnet(23) - Login
    - SSH(22) - Secure Login
    - HTTP(80)
    - HTTPS(443) - Secure
    - SMTP(25)(Mail)
    - IMAP(143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
    - POP(109/110) - Mail Retrieval
    - DNS(53) - Domain Name
    - FTP(21) -File Transfer
